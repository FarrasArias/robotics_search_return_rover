# robotics_search_return_rover

First project for the Robotics Nanodegree. The project consisted on processing the images from the Rovers vision to define its movement and map a navegable terrain. Its code was also optimized to search for specific rocks and collect them. There was a final optimization that allowed the rover to pick new terrain over already navegated one.
